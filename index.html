                <p>Hello! My name is Zachary Musyimi and I am a dedicated and passionate Junior student pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. As a scholar in the prestigious C.D. Mote Jr. Incentive Awards Program, I have continually demonstrated academic excellence and a commitment to my field of study. My journey in Computer Science is not just about personal growth; it's also about community involvement and leadership. I am actively involved in several student organizations, each holding a special place in my quest for personal and professional development. As a mentor in the National Society of Black Engineers and a member of ColorStack, I am deeply committed to fostering diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. My engagement with the African Student Association, Black Student Union, Ethiopian & Eritrean Student Association, and Muslim Student Association at UMD highlights my dedication to celebrating cultural diversity and building strong, supportive communities on campus. Through these experiences, I have honed my skills in leadership, teamwork, and cross-cultural communication, all of which are vital in the ever-evolving world of technology. I am excited to continue my journey, contributing my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact in the field of Computer Science.

                    <h2>Book Respiratory System</h2>
                    <p>Developed an advanced C++ book inventory management application, featuring user-friendly functions for adding, editing, and deleting book records. It includes detailed fields like titles, authors, and ISBNs, and utilizes hash tables and trees for efficient data handling and sorting. The system integrates SQLite for data persistence and offers a command-line interface suitable for non-technical users.</p>

                    <h2>Morse Code Converter</h2>
                    <p>Created a Java-based MorseCodeConverter to translate Morse code into English, using a MorseCodeTree for accurate and efficient conversions. It supports direct input and file uploads, processes lines containing Morse code while skipping blanks for batch conversions, and features a visualization of the MorseCodeTree, making it both a practical tool for decoding and an educational resource for Morse code enthusiasts.</p>

                    <h2>GroupMe Bot</h2>
                    <p>The GroupMe Bot leverages the GroupMe API to enrich group chats with interactive features like real-time NFL schedule updates, including team matchups, dates, and times, along with personalized greetings and intelligent date parsing for specific schedule requests. Beyond sharing sports schedules, it enhances user engagement by responding to certain phrases with casual greetings, making it an invaluable and interactive tool for GroupMe users, particularly those keen on NFL events.</p>
